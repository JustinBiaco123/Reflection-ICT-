<h2 align="center"> My Reflection for 1st Quarter </h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Coding. A word that is yet to be discovered, yet to be learned and yet to be explored by the younger version of myself. However as time passes by, I discovered what coding means and those unbelievable amount of characters and text lines I see in the Internet. My knowledge about this started to grow during grade 8 and will continue to grow this year. <br/> <br/>
In this quarter, I learned a lot of new stuff that involves coding, I learned how XHTML differs from HTML and its basic concepts, I discovered how to make different kind of lists in HTML that can benefit us in many different ways, I knew how to make a table and its content in HTML that has a lot of purpose and can help us deliver information easily, I also gained an understanding on how to link your own website to another and its very important because this feature of the internet is one of the reasons of its success and finally, I acquired the knowledge on how to make forms and its content, it can help us gather information from our audience.Not only I learned all those new things for this quarter, I also enjoyed my overall experience in ICT although I did have some or a lot of struggles throughout the 1st quarter journey. <br/> <br/>
In conclusion, I can confidently say that I fully understand our lessons for ICT during this quarter and I had fun throughout the process. <br/> <br/>
